Global Peace Through Religious Literacy
Created By

Overview
The "No Conversion" Educational Framework is a novel, 100% original global initiative to foster lasting peace by promoting religious literacy without any proselytization or conversion narratives.
Rooted in the belief that conversion-driven religious narratives are a primary cause of religious intolerance, persecution, and minority atrocities, this framework proposes a full stop to such approaches through neutral, evidence-based education.
It focuses on addressing common myths, misconceptions, and historical conflict points—particularly in Hinduism (e.g., caste system, polytheism)—while highlighting shared moral principles across faiths. The goal: raise informed, empathetic citizens who reject brainwashing and embrace tolerance.
Core Principles
•	Strict non-proselytization: Education only, no persuasion or ranking of religions.
•	Evidence-based content from peer-reviewed scholarship and primary texts.
•	Localized adaptation by regional interfaith councils.
•	Delivered by certified multi-faith educator teams.
Key Features
•	Modular Curriculum: Pathways covering myths/realities, shared values, historical contexts, and conflict resolution.
•	Multi-Format Delivery: Interactive digital platforms, case studies, role-playing, community workshops, and school integration.
•	Regional Customization: India-focused modules on Hinduism concerns; Middle East: Judaism/Islam co-creation; Western: extremism & women's rights misconceptions.
•	Scalable Tiers: Digital self-learning → Community dialogues → Institutional train-the-trainer programs.
•	Governance: International advisory board + local interfaith validation.
•	Measurable Impact: Assessments on literacy/empathy; tracking reductions in inter-religious incidents.
•	Sustainable Funding: Grants, CSR, government budgets, micro-certifications.
Vision & Proposal
This framework is proposed for worldwide adoption, with a special call to the Government of India to introduce a "No Conversion Global Initiative" bill integrating this education into national policy.
By teaching truth over narrative, we can end cycles of religious conflict once and for all.
